# Vinted API exercise

Vinted API exercise is a miniature-scale reproduction of the Vinted API that allows users to : create an account, login to this account, create an offer, update this offer (including uploading pictures), filter the offers and delete an offer.

This little educational project was made during my web and mobile developer training with [Le RÃ©acteur](https://www.lereacteur.io/).

* You have a `Windowd/Linux/Mac` machine.

*Option : you can install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to easily make requests.*
